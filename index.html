      <h1>Marital Status Greatly Differs Between Urban and Rural Cities</h1>
      <p><b>By: MONIQUE MULIMA</b><p>

<p> Attitudes towards marriage have changed over the decades in the U.S. Although all across the country has seen demographic changes in marital status, how these changes have manifested can be seen through an urban and rural lens. <p>
  <p>In New York City, which is situated within the most urban state, more people have trended towards not getting married. In Cheyenne, Wyoming, a city in the most rural state, still more than half of adults are married, although divorce rates have slighlty increased. </p>

  </script>

<p>
In Cheyenne the percent of adults married in 1960 was 69%, and although the rate of marriage has decreased in the past six decades, still over half of adults are getting and staying married. In contrast in New York 49% of adults were married in 1960, but by 2019, that has now decreased to just over a third of adults married.
  <p>

    <h2>What is causing the decline?</h3>
      <p>To understand the decline of married adults in urban cities like New York, it is important to look at what the marital statuses of these other adults are.</p>

<div class="chart">
      <iframe title="Half of NYC residents are no longer getting married" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-uWSRg" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uWSRg/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
  </script>

<p>The largest factor that has caused this shift in marital status is that half of adults in New York are not getting married, this is an almost 20% increase from 1960. This also accounts for a large part of the urban and rural divide of marital statuses. In Cheyenne, less than a quarter of adults are not getting married, and this has only increased 4% in the last six decades. Rural cities like Cheyenne are seeing much less adults not choose marriage and this is due to differing social views.<p>

  <h2>What is causing the divide?</h2>
    <p>Urban and rural cities have several social factors that influence why they have differing views on marital and family structures. According to <a href = "https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2011/02/16/the-public-renders-a-split-verdict-on-changes-in-family-structure/"> The Pew Research Center</a>, some of the largest influences are religion and politics.
    </p>

    <p>Religion makes the biggest difference in attitudes towards marriage, with many religions putting an importance on getting married and having a family. Pew found that over half of adults who attend religious ceremonies weekly hold more traditional views on marriage and family, compared to less than 15% of those who never attend religious services. Wyoming has an almost 10% higher rate than New York of people who attend religious services, which may account for some of the divide of views on marriage.
</p>

  <p>Politics are another large factor. Pew Research shows that Republicans are almost 40% more likely to have traditional views on marriage than Democrats. Wyoming, where Cheyenne is located is considered to lean 47% more Republican than the U.S. average according to <a href = "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/">FiveThirtyEight</a>. In the 2020 elections in Cheyenne, Republicans and independents won the majority of votes in every position. In the opposite direction, New York State is considered to lean 22% more Democrat than the U.S. average. In the 2020 elections, the majority of positions in New York City were won by Democrats. This large political divide also accounts for why people in these two different cities may have differing views on marriage.
</p>
<p>
These social and political views influence how people urban and rural cities view the world and make decisions about marriage.
