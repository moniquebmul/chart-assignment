Pitch: 

Headline: New Yorkers who have never been married has doubled since 1960

The questions I want to ansewer with the data is how have marital statuses changed in New York over time. I want to answer which statuses have increased and which have decreased, and are they trending in a certain direction. 

From the data I have found that the population never married has doubled from 1960-2019. The populations married, seperated and widowed have all decreased, which may be because more people are never getting married. However, the percentage of people divorced has risen from 1960-1980 and then been relatively steady.

This data is from the American Communities Survey 1 year estimates. With this data I would use a horizontal stacked bar chart for each of the decades to show how the proportion of the population with each marital status has changed.
